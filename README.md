# Development

Uses the uv python package manager to install the dependencies. 

Use `uv sync` to install the dependencies and create the virtual environment.

You can select the python interpreter from `.venv` in VSCode, and then run the code in the terminal.

Use `uv add <package>` to add a new package to the project. This is preferred to using pip directly.
